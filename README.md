# download_YT_playlist
to download a full playlist from YT

from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-youtube-videos-or-whole-playlist-with-python/
I added a feature to clean filename titles and 
another "fake button" on a same line, just to try it.

put the py file in a folder it will download files to the same place. no improvement around this for the moment. feel free to improve it
